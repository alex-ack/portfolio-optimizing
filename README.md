# stock project notes ðŸ“ˆ

yo! here's the plan:

portfolio A (trading one):
- gotta do 54 trades by may 3rd
- looking at tech stuff (NVDA, AMD, GOOGL etc)
- also some energy plays (FSLR, XOM)
- need ~5 trades per week between the two of us

portfolio B (boring long-term one):
- index funds (VOO, QQQ)
- old reliable companies (brk.b, pg, ko)
- some dividend stuff

rules to not forget:
- can't put more than 20k in one stock
- keep some cash (>2.5k)
- each trade costs $10
- no penny stocks
