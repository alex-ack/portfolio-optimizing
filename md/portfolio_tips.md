# keeping it healthy

here's some stuff to check regularly:

## portfolio A (trading one)
- track our trades - need 2 per week (I think? I lowk forget lol)
- don't throw everything into one stock (stay under $20k each)
- keep some cash for opportunities (but >$2.5k)
- maybe set some stop losses? (like -3% or whatever)
- check the news for our stocks

## portfolio B (chill one)
- mostly leave it alone (that's the point lol)
- maybe rebalance if something gets way too big
- check if any companies have drama

## project deadlines
- gotta be done trading by may 3rd
- final paper due may 19th @ 3:15pm
- need 6-8 pages about what we did

## paper stuff to track
- screenshot good trades
- keep notes on why stuff worked (or didn't)
- track any big market news
