## reading the market rn (january 2025)
stuff that's moving markets:
- political transition (inauguration jan 20)
- interest rates still high
- AI boom still going
- china's economy being weird
- clean energy push

## sectors to watch ðŸ‘€

### tech & AI 
- NVIDIA (NVDA) - they make all the AI chips
- AMD - also chips, cheaper than NVIDIA
- Microsoft (MSFT) - they own OpenAI, doing cool stuff
- Google (GOOGL) - their Gemini AI is heating up

AI isn't slowing down, and new products dropping all the time. when they announce new stuff, stocks usually pop.

### defense & aerospace (election stuff)
- Lockheed (LMT)
- Northrop (NOC)
- Raytheon (RTX)

new administration usually = changes in defense spending.

### clean energy (so hot rn)
- First Solar (FSLR)
- Enphase (ENPH)
- SolarEdge (SEDG)

new president probably gonna talk climate change. these stocks move a LOT on policy news.

### banks (interest rate plays)
- JPMorgan (JPM)
- Bank of America (BAC)
- Goldman Sachs (GS)

interest rates changing = bank profits change. fed meetings are key!

## how to actually trade this stuff

### entry strategies (when to buy):
1. "buy the dip" (but smart):
   - if a good stock drops 5-10% for no real reason
   - make sure nothing's actually wrong first
   - example: NVIDIA drops because whole market is down (not because they messed up)

2. "trend following" (riding momentum):
   - if stock breaks above its previous high
   - volume should be high (lots of people buying)
   - example: Microsoft hits new high after good AI news

3. "news playing":
   - stock drops on news that'll blow over
   - or rises on news that'll last
   - example: clean energy stocks when climate policy announced

### exit strategies (when to sell):
1. taking profits:
   - up 5-8%? maybe sell half
   - up 10%+? definitely consider selling

2. cutting losses:
   - down 3-4%? think about selling
   - down 5%+? probably bail unless you REALLY believe
   - that $10 commission means small trades hurt

### actual trading mechanics:
- use limit orders (don't just buy/sell at market)
- watch the bid-ask spread (difference between buy/sell prices)
- try to trade when market less crazy (not first/last 30 mins)

## practical routine

### morning checks:
1. check what futures doing (google "stock futures")
2. any big news (yahoo finance app good for this)
3. check our stocks' pre-market prices

### during day:
- set price alerts (yahoo finance app)

## how to research stocks fast
1. check the chart (1 month and 3 month)
2. look at RSI (tells if stock too hot/cold)
3. check volume (more = stronger move)
4. quick news scan
5. set price target (up AND down)

## specific trading examples:

### example trade 1: AI momentum
- NVIDIA announces new chip
- wait 15 mins after market opens (let crazy traders chill)
- if still going up, buy some
- set stop loss 4% below
- take profits at 7-8% up

### example trade 2: inauguration play
- watch clean energy sector
- if new president mentions climate change
- stocks like FSLR might pop
- but don't buy AT the speech (too late)
- better to buy few days before if you think it's coming

### example trade 3: earnings
- company reports earnings
- if they beat AND guide higher
- and stock drops anyway
- might be good buy opportunity
- but wait a day (let dust settle)
