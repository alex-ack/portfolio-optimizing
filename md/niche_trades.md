# hmmmmm

## semi-obvious but still hot
### weight loss stocks
- LLY (Eli Lilly) - Zepbound/Mounjaro
- NVO (Novo Nordisk) - Wegovy/Ozempic 
- watch for: FDA stuff, supply updates, insurance coverage news

### AI chips (but the sneaky ones)
- AMD (cheaper NVIDIA play)
- MRVL (Marvell - AI infrastructure)
- AVGO (Broadcom - AI networking)
watch for: NVIDIA news affects these too

## super niche plays

### mexico manufacturing 
- why: companies moving from china
- who: KOF, EWW, ASR
- watch for: more tariff drama

### space internet 
- IRDM (satellite phones)
- GSAT (starlink competitor)
- watch for: spacex news affects these

### sports betting 
- DKNG (DraftKings)
- PENN 
- super bowl coming = usually pop off

### water plays 
- AWK (American Water)
- XYL (water tech)
- climate change + infrastructure play

## weird but maybe smart plays

### "boring but printing" crew 
- waste management (WM)
- self storage (PSA)
- cell towers (AMT)
- everyone hates them = less competition

### luxury recession proof
- LVMH (louis vuitton)
- EL (estee lauder)
- rich people stay rich even in recession

### regional bank recovery
- got destroyed last year
- interest rates helping now
- mergers might happen
- but careful lol

## strategies for these

### the pairs trade
example: long COST (costco), short WMT (walmart)
- if retail good, both up but COST more
- if retail bad, both down but COST less
- either way you might win

### the "rule change" play 
1. watch for new regulations/laws
2. find companies that benefit
3. buy BEFORE everyone realizes

### the "everyone wrong" play
when EVERYONE thinks something will happen... maybe bet against it
- example: everyone thought xbox would kill sony
- reality: playstation won
- look for: too much hype

### supply chain
1. find company doing great
2. look up who makes their stuff
3. buy the suppliers
- example: if NVIDIA crushing, buy their suppliers

## timing tips

### catalysts to watch
- super bowl (betting stocks)
- spring break (travel stocks)
- tax season (tax prep companies)
- iphone season (apple suppliers)

### weird correlations ex's
- cold weather = nat gas up
- election = defense stocks move
- summer = beer stocks up
